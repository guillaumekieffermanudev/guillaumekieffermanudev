## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate developer who never gives up until things work—I'm a tryharder through and through. My expertise lies in building robust web applications with PHP, Symfony, and Prestashop.

I hold a **BAC+4 in Project Leadership, specializing in Web Development**, and a **BAC+2 in Web Design**. Proudly based in the north of France.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me screaming as a metalcore singer or adventuring in World of Warcraft.
